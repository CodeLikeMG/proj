Install Dependencies on the New System
Once you transfer the project folder to the system, open Command Prompt inside the folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all required packages.



Verify Installation
After installation, confirm that all required libraries are installed:

python -c "import PyQt6, scapy.all, nmap, fpdf, requests; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"


If thereâ€™s no error, your environment is ready.



Run the Scanner GUI
Start the scanner by executing:


python anvs_gui.py
If running the script works as expected, you're all set!


Convert to EXE (Optional)
If you need a standalone EXE, use:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico --name ANVS anvs_gui.py

Your EXE will be in the dist/ folder.
